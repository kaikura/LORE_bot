B(11.19 - Join Human Civilian explorers)

The urge to join the human civilian explorers is irresistible, promising an easy path of simple camaraderie and shared purpose. With Dalton at his side, Iraen abandons his royal duties and sets off in pursuit of new experiences.

Despite their optimism, the journey proves hazardous. The civilians, unaccustomed to the wild terrain of Polygon, are ill-prepared to face the relentless adversities of the system. The hostile climate, aggressive fauna, and resource scarcity quickly sap the group's morale, and internal conflicts begin to surface.

When a sudden and violent storm forces them to take shelter in an ancient ruin, Iraen and Dalton make a harrowing discovery. The ruins are not abandoned as they first appeared; they are inhabited by dangerous robotic creatures, activated by their trespassing. The civilians, already weakened, are no match for these ancient protectors.

In the ensuing chaos, Iraen and Dalton attempt to lead a counteroffensive but, with their path to safety cut off, they ultimately fall to the mechanical beasts. The expedition, that had started as an adventure, ends in disaster. Iraen, the Primate Royalty who abandoned his responsibilities, and Dalton, the faithful canine companion, pay the ultimate price for their reckless decision.

D(11.29 - Share a quest with Feline scientists)

Iraen decides to diverge from his original path and join a team of Feline scientists who claim to be on the brink of an amazing discovery. The promise of intellectual stimulation and new knowledge is too tempting to resist, and Iraen, with Dalton loyally by his side, eagerly enlists in their ranks.

The scientists, led by a charismatic Feline called Serafina, welcome them into their ranks. They guide Iraen and Dalton through the wild forests of Polygon, leading them to a hidden underground laboratory filled with advanced technology unlike anything Iraen has ever seen. 

The elation quickly dissipates when Serafina reveals the true purpose of their expedition. They are attempting to harness the energy of Polygon itself, disrupting the natural order in their pursuit of power and control. Iraen, realizing the destructive potential of their quest, attempts to dissuade them. But it's too late. 

The experiment, unstable from the beginning, spirals out of control. The lab collapses in a brilliant flash of energy, obliterating everything in its vicinity. Iraen and Dalton, consumed by the cataclysm, are unable to prevent the catastrophic consequences of their decision to join the Feline scientists. 

--- The End ---

F(11.39 - Chart an unknown path through the lush forest)

In a different thread of reality, Iraen and Dalton veer off their intended course and chart an unknown path through the lush forest. Seduced by the beauty of Polygon's untouched nature and the thrill of unknown, they confidently delve deeper into the dense wilderness.

As they traverse through the tall trees and verdant undergrowth, they become more and more immersed in the wild beauty of the forest. They marvel at the vibrant flora and fauna, the sparkling streams that crisscross their path, and the strange, ethereal creatures that inhabit this region of Polygon.

However, the forest soon proves to be not as benign as it first appeared. Iraen and Dalton get caught in a disorienting fog that seemingly appears out of nowhere. They struggle to find their way, but every direction only leads them further into the dense forest.

Eventually, Iraen and Dalton succumb to the forest's bewitching power. Lost and disoriented, they wander aimlessly, eventually succumbing to the forest's merciless conditions. Their decision to chart an unknown path turns out to be a fatal misstep, halting their journey in the most tragic of ways.

--- The End ---
I(11.49 - Demonstrate peaceful intentions to the ancient beings)

In the midst of their encounter with the mysterious ancient beings, Iraen and Dalton feel a rising tide of trepidation. Sensing their apprehension, the ancient beings grow wary. Iraen, filled with diplomatic acumen, decides to demonstrate their peaceful intentions.

He reaches into his pack and pulls out a small artifact, a humble emblem from their home quadrant, as a token of goodwill. The ancient beings, unaccustomed to such foreign items, regard it with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

Dalton, on the other hand, attempts to make amiable contact through language, using soft words and a friendly tone. But his attempt backfires as his alien accent and unfamiliar phrases seem to agitate the beings, intensifying the tension.

In the end, their well-intended demonstrations prove counterproductive. The ancient beings misinterpret their actions as threats. In the ensuing chaos, Iraen and Dalton are overpowered, becoming the victims of a tragic misunderstanding.

--- The End ---
M(11.59 - Refuse to embrace the nature of Polygon)

Despite the harmonious beauty of Polygon's lush natural environment, Iraen, a creature of technology and the stars, finds himself unable to truly embrace the primal essence of the system. He remains focused on their mission, refusing to allow the overwhelming aura of nature to affect him. Dalton, too, shares his discomfort, their military instincts always on high alert.

They continue their journey, bypassing the allure of sparkling lakes, whispering trees, and melodious wildlife. However, their conscious disconnection from nature gradually becomes an impediment. The sentient flora of Polygon responds to their indifference with hostility, blocking their path and restraining their progress.

The more they resist, the more aggressive the environment becomes. Finally, in a dramatic turn of events, a towering tree ensnares them within its strong branches. Their failure to acknowledge and respect the spirit of Polygon results in their journey being abruptly halted.

--- The End ---

O(11.69 - Look for the oracle of the forest)

Haunted by their failure to connect with Polygon's nature, Iraen and Dalton decide to seek guidance from the Oracle of the Forest. Legends speak of a timeless entity dwelling deep within the woods, holding the knowledge of all that has ever transpired in Polygon. The duo believes that the Oracle could provide them with the wisdom needed to traverse the hostile terrain.

Their journey takes them through lush, undisturbed vegetation where they come face to face with the alien wildlife of Polygon. Every step they take in the dense undergrowth leads them deeper into an environment that is as thrilling as it is perilous.

Eventually, they reach the Oracle's lair. But their hearts sink as they find it abandoned, left to the mercy of time and nature. The Oracle of the Forest, it seems, had retreated from the physical realm centuries ago. Without the Oracle's guidance, Iraen and Dalton find themselves lost and directionless, trapped in the depth of the untamed Polygon forest.

--- The End ---
P(11.79 - Attempt to harness the power of the ancient technology)

Guided by the wisdom of the ancient beings, Iraen believes they can harness the power of the archaic technology scattered around Polygon. Despite their guidance to the contrary, Iraen argues that such power could be the key to protecting their beloved homeland.

Working alongside Dalton, the Primate Royalty pours hours into studying and manipulating the technology. It's a complex mesh of organic components and inorganic circuits, a testament to a civilization that had achieved a perfect symbiosis of nature and technology.

However, their attempts end in calamity. An unexpected surge of energy overloads the system, triggering a cataclysmic reaction that sends waves of disruptive energy across Polygon. The landscape writhes under the onslaught, forests wilting and lakes evaporating within moments. Polygon's balance, so precariously maintained, teeters on the brink of collapse.

Despair fills Iraen and Dalton as they witness the devastating impact of their actions. In trying to harness the power of the ancients, they had unknowingly endangered the very nature they sought to protect.

--- The End ---
S(11.89 - Lead an expedition to the towering mountains)

Iraen, with his newfound knowledge of ancient technology, decides to lead an expedition to the towering mountains. The ancient beings, though skeptical, cannot sway his determination. The mountains are said to harbor more ancient technology and the Primate Royalty hopes to discover something that could tip the scales in their favor.

Assembling a team of capable soldiers, scientists, and explorers, they venture into the mountainous terrain. The journey is treacherous, fraught with peril at every step. Landslides, avalanches, and strange predatory creatures are but a few of the challenges they face.

However, the most significant obstacle is not the treacherous terrain, nor the strange beasts. Instead, it's a deadly energy field that surrounds the mountain's peak. None of their technology can penetrate or withstand it, and every attempt at circumvention results in failure and, in some cases, loss of life.

The expedition ends in tragedy. Despite their best efforts and sacrifices, the deadly energy field proves too much. They're forced to retreat, their ranks significantly reduced and morale crushed. The majestic mountains of Polygon, a symbol of hope and aspiration, now stand as a grim reminder of their failed endeavor.

--- The End ---
U(11.99 - Try to cross the lake)

Unable to unlock the secrets of the Spectral Radar, Iraen makes a desperate decision: to cross the sparkling, mystical lake believed to be a massive energy source. Ancient lore speaks of an otherworldly power beneath its gleaming surface, but crossing it is considered a forbidden act. Despite the warnings of the ancient beings, Iraen is resolute.

The Primate Royalty leads a small group, pushing forth into the shimmering waters. The lake, calm and serene on the surface, roils with potent and unpredictable energy beneath. His group, equipped with state-of-the-art technology, begins their daring attempt to reach the other side.

The moment their vessels touch the water, they're enveloped by a barrage of unseen forces. The energy of the lake proves to be too chaotic and powerful, affecting their equipment and pushing them off course. Their technology, advanced as it may be, is no match for the raw, untamed power of the lake. One by one, their vessels malfunction, leaving them stranded and helpless in the face of the lake's might.

The attempt to cross the lake ends disastrously. Stranded, with their resources depleted and morale shattered, they're left with no choice but to send a distress signal, praying that their plea for help reaches the Polygon system's residents. It is a hard-earned lesson in respect for the ancient laws of nature, and a reminder of the power of the world they're trying to protect.

--- The End ---
V(12.09 - Conceal the relic from the beings)

Armed with the Spectral Radar, a relic of immense power, Iraen takes a controversial decision. He decides to withhold the truth about the relic from the ancient beings. The relic, thought to be a beacon of harmony between the ancient beings and the world of Polygon, is kept a secret, as Iraen fears their reaction.

The ancient beings, perceptive and deeply in tune with the harmony of Polygon, sense something amiss. Their eyes are ageless, their wisdom vast, and they begin to doubt Iraen's intentions. There's a palpable tension in the air, the sense of impending conflict that threatens to disrupt the peace that has stood for millennia.

Iraen's deception is eventually brought to light, sparking off a chain of events that threatens to tear apart the fragile unity they've so painstakingly built. The ancient beings feel betrayed and their trust, once lost, proves difficult to regain. They retract their cooperation and return to their reclusive lives, leaving Iraen and his team to face the dangers of Polygon alone.

Iraen's choice to conceal the relic leads to an irreversible fracture in their relationship with the ancient beings. This results in them being excluded from the final ritual, denied the wisdom and protection of the ancient beings, and left vulnerable to the unknown perils that lurk within the system of Polygon. The journey of discovery takes a bitter turn, and the future of the Polygon system hangs in uncertainty.

--- The End ---
AA(12.19 - Suppress the relic's potential)

After revealing the relic to the ancient beings, Iraen makes an unprecedented decision. Fearing the potentially catastrophic consequences of the relic's uncontrolled use, he decides to suppress its full potential, activating only the bare minimum of its capabilities.

This decision proves controversial, causing dissent within the ranks of the crew and the ancient beings alike. Some believe in the relic's power to bring about a new era of prosperity and peace for Polygon. Others see the potential for misuse and applaud Iraen's caution. The discord sows seeds of disunity and suspicion, tarnishing their once harmonious relationship.

As the team proceeds with the suppressed relic, the limitations become evident. Their progress is stunted, the secrets of Polygon remaining locked behind the barriers they can no longer break. The relic, stripped of its potency, is unable to fully resonate with the ancient energies of Polygon, leaving them blind to the system's greater truths.

Iraen's decision to suppress the relic's potential costs them dearly. The unknown forces of Polygon, sensing their weakness, begin to rise. Without the full power of the relic, the team struggles to fend off the escalating threats, leading to their untimely retreat from the system. Iraen's choice to withhold the relic's power leaves the mysteries of Polygon undiscovered and their mission unfulfilled.

EE(91111111111111 - Let the energy flow through your body)

The ancient ritual has begun, and the energy coursing through the circle is intense, almost tangible. Iraen, sitting on the sidelines, has a choice to make. Against his better judgment, he decides to let the energy flow through his body, hoping to understand and connect with the powerful forces at work.

As the energy enters his body, it's like nothing he's ever experienced. His senses are heightened, his awareness expands, and he can feel the life force of Polygon pulsating through him. It's overwhelming but also deeply exhilarating. He feels one with Polygon, connected to every being, every tree, every stone.

However, the intense surge of energy proves too much for his body to handle. He suddenly feels lightheaded, the world around him spinning. He tries to disconnect from the flow, but it's too late. The energy has consumed him, its raw power too much for his physical form.

With a final gasp, Iraen collapses, the vibrant energy of Polygon fading from his sight. The decision to let the energy flow through him, though made with good intentions, has proven fatal. His body, unable to contain such power, gave out, ending his journey through the Polygon system.

--- The End ---

HH(9111111111111111 - Perform the ancient prophecy)

Choosing to follow the path of prophecy, Iraen steps up to the sacred circle. He takes a deep breath, preparing himself for what's to come. The energy around him pulsates, vibrant and alive. Closing his eyes, he begins the ritual, his voice rising above the hum of energy.

As he chants, Iraen feels a powerful force coursing through him, connecting him with the very essence of Polygon. It's an exhilarating sensation, unlike anything he's ever felt. His body feels light, almost ethereal, and he's caught in a whirlwind of raw, primal energy.

However, as Iraen delves deeper into the ritual, he starts to feel the toll it's taking on him. The energy coursing through him is far too powerful, far too wild. His body trembles, his vision blurs, and he can feel himself losing control.

In a matter of moments, Iraen's connection to the powerful force becomes his downfall. Unable to control the energy, he succumbs to its overwhelming power, his body collapsing to the ground. His journey in Polygon ends not as a savior, but as a warning to those who dare to tamper with powers beyond their understanding.

--- The End ---

HH(9111111111111111 - Let the ritual continue)

Iraen, choosing to let the ritual continue without his direct participation, steps back from the sacred circle. The ancient beings hum and chant, their voices harmonizing with the ambient energy of the area. Iraen watches with awe, the air pulsating with a force that is both vibrant and profoundly serene.

The beings move with an elegance that is hard to comprehend, their forms shifting and merging with the energies they control. They seem to be in a trance, their collective consciousness channeling the life force of Polygon. As the ritual progresses, the area around them lights up with an ethereal glow, casting long, dancing shadows against the backdrop of the lush green forests.

Suddenly, without warning, the tranquility of the scene is shattered. The energy, once vibrant and controlled, becomes erratic and chaotic. Iraen watches in horror as the beings convulse, their bodies unable to handle the raw power they've unleashed. One by one, they fall, their energy signatures flickering out until only silence remains.

In his desire to observe rather than participate, Iraen fails to foresee the danger. The power unleashed is too great, the ancient beings unable to contain it. With their fall, the balance of Polygon is tipped, leading to an uncontrolled outpour of energy that leaves the once pristine world in chaos.

--- The End ---

II(91111111111111111 - Resist the prophecy's call)

Deciding to resist the prophecy's call, Iraen pulls back from the edge of the ritual circle, a sense of dread filling his mind. The ritual beings continue their chant, their voices rising and falling in a pattern that seems to resonate with the rhythm of the Polygon itself. 

Suddenly, the world seems to pause, as though holding its breath. The ancient beings freeze mid-movement, their bodies held aloft by an unseen force. Their voices falter, then stop. It is as though they are waiting for something... or someone. They turn to Iraen, their ancient eyes filled with expectation.

Yet Iraen refuses to answer the call. He stands his ground, turning away from the circle. A sense of unease fills the air, and a cold wind whistles through the trees. The ancient beings appear to deflate, their forms flickering and wavering like mirages.

Refusing to fulfill the prophecy, Iraen ultimately seals the fate of Polygon. The ancient technology remains unused, and the potential to protect Polygon is lost. Without the Guardian, the world becomes vulnerable to threats it could have otherwise withstood. The world's balance tilts, leading to disastrous consequences that ripple across the system.
